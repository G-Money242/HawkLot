# HawkLot
A parking-space sharing service.   This year, the parking lot rules at Maine South changed so that specific spots are reserved for the entire year. But, nobody users his/her shower every day--there are days when a substantial portion of the parking lot sits empty. This is an inefficient and unfair system for those who were not able to get a parking pass.
